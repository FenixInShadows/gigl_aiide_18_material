# gigl_aiide_18_material

This repo contains the GIGL code and compared handwritten C++ code for all examples (Monster, Tree, Dungeon with variants) appeared in the AIIDE-18 publication. Here the files are only part of a demo project, for trying running the demos please refer to resources in the other repo (https://github.com/FenixInShadows/gigl_deliverables) and the instructions (https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/grammatical-item-generation-language/demos).

Please note that these code samples may have very minor fixed on types (like mistyped int/float/bool which result in auto-converting in compile time) since the version of the manuscript submission, which has almost no effect on run time, and has a minimal effect on the code size that is within the precision of the showed results in the paper.
